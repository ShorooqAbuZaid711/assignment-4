# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website (React + Vite)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a modern, responsive React-based personal portfolio web application, originally built in Assignment 1, expanded in Assignment 2, and now fully 
enhanced in Assignment 3.

The application now includes:

- A dynamic homepage with live GitHub API integration

This project forms the foundation of my professional developer portfolio and demonstrates advanced front-end skills.

- Benefit → Faster debugging, improved UI consistency, clearer component structure.
- Challenge → Ensuring suggestions did not introduce unnecessary changes.
- Learning Outcome → Strengthened understanding of React state flow, context management, UI styling, and API integration.
